overview
--------
_aonyx is in beta state. There are still more features I wish to add and some refactoring that needs to be done._

aonyx is a very simple, very small dependency manager/injector for node. It does *NOT* provide require-like functionality, instead it is designed to give developers a means of injecting
"services" into functions based on their parameter names. This is not unlike what [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) provides.

v0.2 changes
------------
Below is a list of changes made for release version 0.2 of aonyx. I have strived to keep the api the same as version 0.1 Unfortunately, there are a few minor spots where that was not possible. 
Luckily the few minor changes are on a function that really dosen't need to be used outside of aonyx itself (arguments).

* Rewrote in pure javascript. Various reasons, biggest being wanted to clean up my development process.
* Incorporated [esprima](http://esprima.org/) for argument parsing. No more regular expressions!
* Changed aonyx.arguments to ayonx.args. Arguments is a reserved word, dumb of me to use it :)
* The aonyx.args method signature now accepts an array as the second paramter. In v0.1 the method would parse out the first and last arguments and use the "middle" for it's argument array.

installation
------------
    npm install aonyx

using aonyx
-----------
Using aonyx is simple. You just need to follow a couple easy steps.

First, you need to register your service with aonyx. This is accomplished like so...

    aonyx = require 'aonyx'

    class MyService
        myMethod: (something) ->
            return something

    aonyx.register 'MyService', MyService

Great! Now we have a service registered with the name "myService" (note that aonyx uses camelCase and will transform UpperCamel into lowerCamel). This service simple, just a class with a single
method, but it serves our purpose.

Next, we have to have a function that's going to need that service. Once we have that, we need to tell aonyx to do its injection magic. Lukcily this is easier than it sounds...

    aonyx = require 'aonyx'

    myFunction = (myService) ->
        service = new myService()
        console.log service.myMethod('Hey There')

    # This creates a new injector and then immediately calls it
    aonyx.inject(myFunction)()

Simple, right? There's more you can do with aonyx, though! For instance, aonyx will merge service resolutions with regular arguments. Take this example...

    myFunction = (myService, someParam) ->
        service = new myService()
        console.log service.myMethod(someParam) # Will log "Yolo!"

    aonyx.inject(myFunction)('Yolo!')

It doesn't even matter what order your parameters are in, aonyx will just put them all together for you correctly... well, kind of :) There is more information about how aonyx merges service injections and argument lists.

aonyx also provides the ability to add the 'injector' and 'inject' methods directly to the Function prototype. This is disabled by default, for obvious reasons, but can be turned on
pretty easily. These are really just short hand for different approaches above. Here's an example of using the Function prototype methods...

    aonyx = require 'aonyx'
    aonyx.proto true # Enable the Function prototype methods. Call aonyx.proto false to remove them.

    myFunction = (myService, someParam) ->
        service = new myService()
        console.log service.myMethod(someParam) # Will log "Yolo!"

    # Doing the injection immediately
    myFunction.inject('Yolo!')

    # Using an injector, in case you need to defer execution (i.e: setting up a resolver, see below).
    injector = myFunction.injector()

    ...

    injector('Yolo!')

Now, what happens if you want to be able to resolve a service at resolution time? When might this be handy? Let's say you want to be able to inject the current http response object into a method.
You can't just register a service that returns the response object as the response is different for each request. Ideally you'd be able to resolve a request for service at the time it's requested,
right when you have the response object handy. Luckily for us, aonyx provides a way to do this. Take the following example...

    # In some file, somewhere...
    module.exports =
        myRouteHandler: ($response) ->
            $response.send 'Hello there!'

    # In our server.coffee file...
    aonyx = require 'aonyx'
    routeHandler = require 'some/file/somewhere'

    app.get '/my/route', (request, response, next) ->
        injector = aonyx.inject(routeHandler.myRouteHandler)

        injector.resolver (service) ->
            # NOTE: In order for service and argument merging to work, you must return
            # null from your resolver if you can't resolve the requested service.
            return null if service isnt '$response'
            return response
        injector()

What's happening here is we are first creating our injector for our route handler method. We are then defining a resolver method which will be called when aonyx finds a parameter
for which it can't resolve. In our resolver method we're saying "If you're asking for a $response service, take this response object.. if not, return null". You need to always return
null from your resolver if you can't resolve the requested service. This makes it so aonyx can continue to properly merge our service resolutions with our arguments.

Simple, yeah?

##### A note about merging service injections and arguments
When aonyx builds the service list that will be injected into a function, it will put null in place for services that are not found. These nulls will be replaced with values from
our passed in arguments. In a hypothetical situation, aonyx may return the following service-injected array, where the second and fourth parameters couldn't be matched with a registered service...

    [ { foo: 'bar' }, null, function() { ... }, null ]

And the arguments passed to our inject method look something like this

    [ true, { some: 'other object' } ]

The final array, which will be passed to our "injectee", would look something like this...

    # Notice the nulls were replaced by the values of the arguments supplied to aonyx.
    [ { foo: 'bar' }, true, function() { ... }, { some: 'other object' } ]
    
##### What if I want to "new up" an injectable method?
Because of the way JavaScript treats constructors, this is not as simple as it looks as first. Ideally, you would be able to just call aonyx.inject(myConstructor) and everything would work
just fine. However, that's not the case. Since JavaScript doesn't play nice when applying/calling constructors, we had to implement a work around for this. This is only a temporary solution
until we found one we like more.

Now, let's show you how to do this...

    # Let's assume MyClass and MyObject are already registered with aonyx and the
    # constructor for MyClass is expecting MyObject to be injected into it. 
    
    # Note that myClass will be injected in and is a function that can be new'd up.
    myFunction = (myClass) ->
        instance = aonyx.inject(myClass, yes).call(myClass) # We want to keep our scope to our class
        return instance.myObject
        
Note the second parameter on the inject method (false by default). This is telling aonyx that it should new up this method during the injection process. What this will return is a new MyClass object with
the services requested in the constructor injected. You do not need to (and probably should not) "new up" the function returned by aonyx.inject. This is handled for you when you pass true
as the second parameter to the inject function. 
        

faqs
----

*Why aonyx? Doesn't node already provide a dependency management system (require)?*
> It sure does, and it's awesome. It does what it does really really well. With that said, aonyx was designed for a different purpose. Aonyx's strength comes from being able
to provide module developers with a way to give their users the ability to specificy exactly what they need at a given point, rather than giving them everything and then leaving
it up to the consuming code to figure out what it wants and doesn't want.


*Well, couldn't I just provide all the "services" as callback arguments?*
> You sure could. In fact, that's the way most modules work. However while working on another project of mine, [otter](https://github.com/jaylach/node-otter), I found I had a need
to allow my module users the ability request which services they wanted rather than just giving them everything as an argument list. There were a lot of different services callbacks
could want and methods with long parameter lists are kind of ugly. So, aonyx was born.

*Can I use aonyx in my non-module application?*
> Sure but it's probably not needed. In most cases you'll find that the tools node gives you out of the box do everything you need, and more.
